    <string name="bio_text">Hola!, I am Chibueze Michael Aniezeofor ,a mechanical engineering student at the University of Nigeria who is passionate about software development.I have a strong passion for learning about new technologies, and I am always looking for new ways to improve my skills. During my years of experience, I have developed a nucleus energy towards backend technologies, a strong understanding of the software development process, and have gained valuable experience in the field of software development.

Aside from my passion for software development, I aspire to create innovations that benefit the people of Earth or possibly aliens (if they exist).


Due to the force of attraction between the  nucleus (ME) and my my first level eletrons (backend development), I consider myself a backend developer although i also learn technologies outside my field. Below are the technologies I have worked with.</string>
